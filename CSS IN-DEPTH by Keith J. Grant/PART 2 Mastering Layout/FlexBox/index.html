    <!-- This approach, popularized by web designer Ethan Marcotte, is called responsive design. -->
    <!-- Newspaper sites are particularly interesting because they have so much content crammed onto the page. -->
    <!-- www.bostonglobe.com/ is a great example, offering a one-, two-, or three-column layout depending on the width of your browser window. -->
    <!-- Typicallly, you can resize the width of the browser window and see the page layout respond immediately. -->
    <!-- The three key principles to responsive design:
===> 1. A mobile first approach to design... This means you build the mobile version before you construct the desktop layout.
===> 2. The @media at-rule... With this rule, you can tailor your styles for viewports of different sizes. writing styles for diffrent conditions.
===> 3. The use of fluid layouts...  This approach allows containers to scale to different sizes based on the width of the viewport. -->

    <!-- breakpoint—A particular point at which the page styles change to provide the best possible layout for the screen size. -->

    <!-- Because you’ll build the mobile design first, it’s important to have an idea of how the larger viewports will look as that can influence 
        how you structure the HTML. -->
    
    <!--  The markup looks much the same as that for a non-responsive design. I’ve made a couple of considerations for the mobile design. -->
